# GIT INTRODUCTION
To initialize a new repository you have to do it inside of a specific folder

mkdir my_new_repository
cd my_new_repository

The following command initialize a new repository inside of `my_new_repository`
git init

Adding files
touch README

Edit the file with your prefered text editor, and commit the file with the following commands

git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'

To see what happens on every stage of the repository just use the following commands

git status ## To see which files have been modified
git diff   ## To watch the LOC (Lines Of Code) changed, added and deleted
git log    ## To see the commits on the current branch

To create branches you have to run the following command

git checkout -b [your_branch_name]

Repeat the commit process every time you add something to the files

To merge this information you have to use the recursive strategy with

git checkout master
git merge --no-ff [your_branch_name]
